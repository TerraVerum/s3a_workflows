# S3A Workflows

This is the workflow engine in the back of S3A. It is also a dependency for the Silkscore algorithm as of this writing.

Note: the requirements setup is a little hacky at present to account for the fact it pulls the S3A pypi package from PyPi
and that is an old S3A without the latest updates.
